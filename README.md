# General info
This is a simple project of integrating an API with a HTML page.
I used GitHub API Version 3 to build an application which runs a search querry on github and gives a result based on a user name entered.

The information requested and rendered on the page includes :

* 1.full username
* 2.Image Avatar
* 3.Account creation  date
* 4.Followers(number)
* 5. Following(number)
* 6. number of public repos
* 7. Company name

##Technologies

This page involves a few languages 
* HTML - a simple page with a search form  
* CSS- some simple styling on the web page
* JAVASCRIPT- incoporating event listeners, fetch requests, manipulating the DOM , using queryselectors.
