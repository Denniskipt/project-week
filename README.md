## General info
This is a simple project of integrating an API with a HTML page.
I used GitHub API Version 3 to build an application which runs a search querry on github and gives a result based on a user name entered.
The information requested and rendered on the page includes :
1.full username
2.Image Avatar
3.Account creation  date
4.Followers(number)
5. Following(number)
6. number of public repos
7. Company name

##Technologies

This page involves a few languages 
* HTML - a simple page with a search form  
* CSS- some simple styling on the web page
* JAVASCRIPT- incoporating event listeners, fetch requests, manipulating the DOM , using queryselectors.

##Credits
I Give credit to all Moringa Technical Mentors and fellow Students for helping me out in blockers 
The canvas content is as well very helpful and guiding.
